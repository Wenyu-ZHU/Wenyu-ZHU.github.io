## What is data science?

From Modern Data Science with R: 

“[Data Science is] the science of extracting meaningful information from data” 

Several key ideas embedded in this statement: 

- Data science is a science, a rigorous discipline that combines elements of statistics and computer science with roots in mathematics.

- Data science is best applied in the context of expert knowledge about the domain from which the data originated.


### A ring of Data Science -- Visualization

“The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see.”
– John Tukey (American statistician and creator of the boxplot and many other things)

“Visualization is often used for evil - twisting insignificant data changes and making them look meaningful. Don’t do that crap if you want to be my friend. Present results clearly and honestly. If something isn’t working - those reviewing results need to know.” 
– John Tukey

#### A good plot should have:
- Label the axis

- Have a title

- Make sure the title and axis are large enough

- Label the plot or have a legend

- Text on plots is great!

- Use color and fill effectively to differentiate groups

- Don’t make a plot overly complex – if it is getting too complex
perhaps make two plots

- Get rid of non-essentials

##### To understand what a good plot is, it is helpful to look at some bad plots. Let’s see some bad plots courtesy of Karl Broman:

In the blog part, I give some simple drawing methods in ggplot2.
